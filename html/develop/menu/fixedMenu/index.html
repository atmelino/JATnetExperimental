		<li><a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>
	</ul>


	<div class=section id=L384>
		<h2>A pinned-down menu</h2>

		<p>The menu you see on the right on this page is simply a UL list.
			But, it stays fixed when you scroll the page. (You may have to make
			the window smaller to get a scroll bar first.) All the work to make
			it stay in place is done by rules in the style sheet. Here is the
			mark-up of the menu, it is taken straight from the source of this
			page:
		<pre>&lt;ul id=menu&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#L384"&gt;Section 1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#details"&gt;Section 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#FAQ"&gt;Section 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>

		<p>In a browser without CSS, or with CSS turned off, it will just
			be a normal list with links. But with CSS, thanks to the rules below,
			it will appear to “float” on top of the page, pinned to the right
			side of the browser window:
		<pre>#menu {
  position: fixed;
  right: 0;
  top: 50%;
  width: 8em;
  margin-top: -2.5em;
}</pre>

		<p>
			The interesting rule here is the '
			<code>position: fixed</code>
			', that makes the DIV stay fixed on the screen. The '
			<code>top: 50%</code>
			' and '
			<code>right: 0</code>
			' determine where the DIV is displayed, in this case: 50% down from
			the top of the window, and a constant 0px from the right. Other
			properties, margins, borders, colors, etc., can be added according to
			personal taste.
		<p>There exist also 'left' and 'bottom' properties, to anchor the
			element to the left or bottom of the screen.
	</div>

	<div class=section id=details>
		<h2>More details</h2>

		<p>
			More precisely: Once an element has been fixed with '
			<code>position: fixed</code>
			', the three properties 'left', 'width' and 'right' together
			determine the horizontal position and size, relative to the window.
			(CSS uses the more general word <em>viewport;</em> a window is an
			example of a viewport.)
		<p>You need at most two of the three properties, i.e., left &amp;
			width, right &amp; width, or left &amp; right. Setting just one of
			the three, or none at all is also possible. In that case, CSS will
			use the element's natural (“intrinsic”) size and/or position, as
			needed, for any properties that are left at their default value
			('auto').
		<p>The same holds for the trio 'top', 'height' and 'bottom'. You
			need to set at most two of them: 'top' if you want to control the
			distance from the top of the window, 'bottom' to control the distance
			from the bottom, and 'height' if you want to specify a fixed height.
		<p>
			If you look at the actual style sheet embedded in this page, you will
			see some additional rules that appear to contradict each other. Those
			are there to protect against bugs in a few older browsers. See <a
				href="#FAQ">below.</a>

	<div class=section id=FAQ>
		<h2>FAQ: IE 5 &amp; 6 on Windows?</h2>

		<p>If you look at this page with Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 or
			6 on Windows (“WinIE5” and “WinIE6”), you'll notice that it doesn't
			work. Many people ask me about that, so here is bit of explanation.
			In brief: the bug is in the browser, not in this page.
		<p>WinIE5 and WinIE6 don't implement 'fixed'. That is unfortunate,
			but the bigger problem is that they also don't parse the 'position'
			property correctly. A browser that doesn't know 'fixed' should throw
			away the rule 'position: fixed' and fall back to whatever the
			previous value of 'position' in the style sheet was. We could then
			add 'position: absolute' just before the 'fixed' and the browser
			would use that. But in WinIE 5 and 6 that is not what happens.
			Apparently the keyword 'fixed' is somehow interpreted as 'static'.
		<p>
			You cannot make WinIE5 and 6 support 'fixed', but there is a
			work-around for the parsing problem. Johannes Koch alerted me to this
			trick (from his <a
				href="http://w3development.de/css/hide_css_from_browsers/">collection
				of work-arounds</a>). First replace the 'position: fixed' in the style
			rules above by 'position: absolute' and then insert the following
			rule in the style sheet:
		<pre>intro {position: fixed}</pre>

		<p>The effect of this is that browsers that know about the '&gt;'
			(child) selector of CSS will use this rule, but browsers that don't,
			in particular WinIE5 and WinIE6, will ignore it. The rule 'position:
			absolute' will be used instead and the menu will be in the right
			place, except that it will not stay fixed when you scroll.
		<p>It is important that there are no spaces around the '&gt;'.
